If the Project Name you have provided is unique, this list should be empty.  
<br>
If the Project Name you have provided has multiple matches on the Hub server then this list will be populated with the Id's of the matching projects. 
<br>
There is a 2 second delay so that the Project Name can be checked against the Hub server for matches before filling out this drop-down list.
