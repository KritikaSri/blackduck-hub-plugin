In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\r\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor\u0027s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\r\n5.

By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author\u0027s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWe call this license the \u0026quot;Lesser\u0026quot; General Public License because it does Less to protect the user\u0027s freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users\u0027 freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \u0026quot;work based on the library\u0026quot; and a \u0026quot;work that uses the library\u0026quot;. The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cb\u003e0.\u003c/b\u003e This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \u0026quot;this License\u0026quot;). Each licensee is addressed as \u0026quot;you\u0026quot;.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nA \u0026quot;library\u0026quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe \u0026quot;Library\u0026quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \u0026quot;work based on the Library\u0026quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \u0026quot;modification\u0026quot;.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u0026quot;Source code\u0026quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003e1.\u003c/b\u003e You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library\u0027s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003e2.\u003c/b\u003e You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cdl\u003e\r\n\u003cdd\u003ea) The modified work must itself be a software library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ec) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ed) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003e(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c/dl\u003e3.\u003c/b\u003e You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n4.\u003c/b\u003e You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n5.\u003c/b\u003e A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nHowever, linking a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \u0026quot;work that uses the library\u0026quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n6.\u003c/b\u003e As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer\u0027s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdl\u003e\r\n\u003cdd\u003ea) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eb) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user\u0027s computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ec) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ed) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ee) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c/dl\u003eFor an executable, the required form of the \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n7.\u003c/b\u003e You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdl\u003e\r\n\u003cdd\u003ea) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c/dl\u003e8.\u003c/b\u003e You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n9.\u003c/b\u003e You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n10.\u003c/b\u003e Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\u0027 exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n11.\u003c/b\u003e If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n12.\u003c/b\u003e If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n13.\u003c/b\u003e The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \u0026quot;any later version\u0026quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n14.\u003c/b\u003e If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nNO WARRANTY \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n15. \u003c/b\u003eBECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author\u0027s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWe call this license the \u0026quot;Lesser\u0026quot; General Public License because it does Less to protect the user\u0027s freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users\u0027 freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \u0026quot;work based on the library\u0026quot; and a \u0026quot;work that uses the library\u0026quot;. The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cb\u003e0.\u003c/b\u003e This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \u0026quot;this License\u0026quot;). Each licensee is addressed as \u0026quot;you\u0026quot;.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nA \u0026quot;library\u0026quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe \u0026quot;Library\u0026quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \u0026quot;work based on the Library\u0026quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \u0026quot;modification\u0026quot;.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u0026quot;Source code\u0026quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003e1.\u003c/b\u003e \u003ca name\u003d\"maximumUsageLevelLicense\"\u003eYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library\u0027s complete source code as you receive it\u003c/a\u003e, in any medium, provided that \u003ca name\u003d\"includeLicenseRestrictionLicense\"\u003eyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003ca name\u003d\"feeForSoftwareRestrictionLicense\"\u003eYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy\u003c/a\u003e, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003e2.\u003c/b\u003e \u003ca name\u003d\"modificationRestrictionLicense\"\u003eYou may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above\u003c/a\u003e, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cdl\u003e\r\n\u003cdd\u003ea) The modified work must itself be a software library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eb) \u003ca name\u003d\"sourceNoticesRestrictionLicense\"\u003eYou must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ec) \u003ca name\u003d\"includeAddedCodeRestrictionLicense\"\u003eYou must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ed) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003e(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.

If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c/dl\u003e3.\u003c/b\u003e You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n4.\u003c/b\u003e You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n5.\u003c/b\u003e \u003ca name\u003d\"joinLevelLicense2\"\u003eA program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nHowever, linking a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \u0026quot;work that uses the library\u0026quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n6.\u003c/b\u003e As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer\u0027s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License.

A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user\u0027s computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ec) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ed) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ee) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c/dl\u003eFor an executable, the required form of the \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.

Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.

Distribution Obligations.\n3.1. Availability of Source Code.\nAny Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n3.2. Modifications.\nThe Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n3.3. Required Notices.\nYou must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\nYou may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients� rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\nYou may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient�s rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n3.6. Larger Works.\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\n4. Versions of the License.\n4.1. New Versions.\nOracle Corp. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.\n4.2. Effect of New Versions.\nYou may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\n4.3. Modified Versions.\nWhen You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\nCOVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n6. TERMINATION.\n6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\n6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY�S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\nThe Covered Software is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. �252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \"commercial computer software documentation\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\n9. MISCELLANEOUS.\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction�s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys� fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\nNOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)\nThe code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.\nThe GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nPreamble\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation\u0027s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nAlso, for each author\u0027s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\u0027 reputations.\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0027s free use or not licensed at all.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\u0027s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\u0027 exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\nNO WARRANTY\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\nOne line to give the program\u0027s name and a brief idea of what it does.\nCopyright (C)\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\nGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w\u0027. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c\u0027 for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w\u0027 and `show c\u0027 should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w\u0027 and `show c\u0027; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision\u0027 (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\nTy Coon, President of Vice\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.\n\"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2\nCertain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its affiliates are subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPLv2, based on the GNU Project exception for its Classpath libraries, known as the GNU Classpath Exception, but only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file\u0027s header the words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the \"Classpath\" exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code.\"\nYou should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent programs in this software package. Some of those programs are provided under licenses deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software Foundation and others. For example, the package includes programs licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. Such programs are licensed to you under their original licenses.\nOracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding the Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which permits you to use that code in combination with other independent modules not licensed under the GPLv2. However, note that this would not permit you to commingle code under an incompatible license with Oracle\u0027s GPLv2 licensed code by, for example, cutting and pasting such code into a file also containing Oracle\u0027s GPLv2 licensed code and then distributing the result.\nAdditionally, if you were to remove the Classpath Exception from any of the files to which it applies and distribute the result, you would likely be required to license some or all of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well, and since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to further distribute the package.\nProceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a lawyer skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath Exception or making modifications to this package which may subsequently be redistributed and/or involve the use of third party software.\nCLASSPATH EXCEPTION\nLinking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole combination.\nAs a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that module. An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version."

In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\r\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor\u0027s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\r\n5.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation\u0027s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. \u003ca name\u003d\"openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense2\"\u003eYou must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code\u003c/a\u003e.

If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\u0027 reputations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0027s free use or not licensed at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003col start\u003d\"0\" style\u003d\"margin-left: -14\"\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003e This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.

For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cli\u003eYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.

By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author\u0027s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWe call this license the \u0026quot;Lesser\u0026quot; General Public License because it does Less to protect the user\u0027s freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users\u0027 freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \u0026quot;work based on the library\u0026quot; and a \u0026quot;work that uses the library\u0026quot;. The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cb\u003e0.\u003c/b\u003e This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \u0026quot;this License\u0026quot;). Each licensee is addressed as \u0026quot;you\u0026quot;.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nA \u0026quot;library\u0026quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe \u0026quot;Library\u0026quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \u0026quot;work based on the Library\u0026quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \u0026quot;modification\u0026quot;.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u0026quot;Source code\u0026quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003e1.\u003c/b\u003e You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library\u0027s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003e2.\u003c/b\u003e You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cdl\u003e\r\n\u003cdd\u003ea) The modified work must itself be a software library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ec) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ed) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003e(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c/dl\u003e3.\u003c/b\u003e You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n4.\u003c/b\u003e You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n5.\u003c/b\u003e A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nHowever, linking a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \u0026quot;work that uses the library\u0026quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n6.\u003c/b\u003e As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer\u0027s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdl\u003e\r\n\u003cdd\u003ea) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eb) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user\u0027s computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ec) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ed) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ee) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c/dl\u003eFor an executable, the required form of the \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n7.\u003c/b\u003e You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdl\u003e\r\n\u003cdd\u003ea) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c/dl\u003e8.\u003c/b\u003e You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n9.\u003c/b\u003e You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n10.\u003c/b\u003e Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\u0027 exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n11.\u003c/b\u003e If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n12.\u003c/b\u003e If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n13.\u003c/b\u003e The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \u0026quot;any later version\u0026quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n14.\u003c/b\u003e If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nNO WARRANTY \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n15. \u003c/b\u003eBECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author\u0027s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWe call this license the \u0026quot;Lesser\u0026quot; General Public License because it does Less to protect the user\u0027s freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users\u0027 freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \u0026quot;work based on the library\u0026quot; and a \u0026quot;work that uses the library\u0026quot;. The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cb\u003e0.\u003c/b\u003e This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \u0026quot;this License\u0026quot;). Each licensee is addressed as \u0026quot;you\u0026quot;.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nA \u0026quot;library\u0026quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe \u0026quot;Library\u0026quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \u0026quot;work based on the Library\u0026quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \u0026quot;modification\u0026quot;.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u0026quot;Source code\u0026quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003e1.\u003c/b\u003e You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library\u0027s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003e2.\u003c/b\u003e You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cdl\u003e\r\n\u003cdd\u003ea) The modified work must itself be a software library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ec) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ed) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003e(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c/dl\u003e3.\u003c/b\u003e You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n4.\u003c/b\u003e You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n5.\u003c/b\u003e A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nHowever, linking a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \u0026quot;work that uses the library\u0026quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n6.\u003c/b\u003e As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer\u0027s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdl\u003e\r\n\u003cdd\u003ea) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eb) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user\u0027s computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ec) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ed) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ee) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c/dl\u003eFor an executable, the required form of the \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n7.\u003c/b\u003e You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdl\u003e\r\n\u003cdd\u003ea) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c/dl\u003e8.\u003c/b\u003e You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n9.\u003c/b\u003e You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n10.\u003c/b\u003e Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\u0027 exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n11.\u003c/b\u003e If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n12.\u003c/b\u003e If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n13.\u003c/b\u003e The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \u0026quot;any later version\u0026quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n14.\u003c/b\u003e If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nNO WARRANTY \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n15. \u003c/b\u003eBECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author\u0027s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWe call this license the \u0026quot;Lesser\u0026quot; General Public License because it does Less to protect the user\u0027s freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users\u0027 freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \u0026quot;work based on the library\u0026quot; and a \u0026quot;work that uses the library\u0026quot;. The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cb\u003e0.\u003c/b\u003e This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \u0026quot;this License\u0026quot;). Each licensee is addressed as \u0026quot;you\u0026quot;.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nA \u0026quot;library\u0026quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe \u0026quot;Library\u0026quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \u0026quot;work based on the Library\u0026quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \u0026quot;modification\u0026quot;.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u0026quot;Source code\u0026quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003e1.\u003c/b\u003e You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library\u0027s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003e2.\u003c/b\u003e You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cdl\u003e\r\n\u003cdd\u003ea) The modified work must itself be a software library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ec) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003ed) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003e(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdd\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c/dl\u003e3.\u003c/b\u003e You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n4.\u003c/b\u003e You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n5.\u003c/b\u003e A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nHowever, linking a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \u0026quot;work that uses the library\u0026quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n6.\u003c/b\u003e As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer\u0027s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdl\u003e\r\n\u003cdd\u003ea) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.

By contrast,\r\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\r\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\r\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\r\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\r\nany other work released this way by its authors.

The systematic\r\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\r\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\r\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\r\nproducts.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation\u0027s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. \u003ca name\u003d\"openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense1\"\u003eYou must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code\u003c/a\u003e.

If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\u0027 reputations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0027s free use or not licensed at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003col start\u003d\"0\" style\u003d\"margin-left: -14\"\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003e This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.

For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cli\u003eYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation\u0027s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. \u003ca name\u003d\"openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense1\"\u003eYou must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code\u003c/a\u003e.

If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\u0027 reputations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0027s free use or not licensed at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003col start\u003d\"0\" style\u003d\"margin-left: -14\"\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003e This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.

COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\r\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, \u003ca name\u003d\"indemnificationRestrictionLicense\"\u003eif a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.\u003c/a\u003e The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\r\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor\u0027s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\r\n5.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation\u0027s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. \u003ca name\u003d\"openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense1\"\u003eYou must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code\u003c/a\u003e.

If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\u0027 reputations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0027s free use or not licensed at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003col start\u003d\"0\" style\u003d\"margin-left: -14\"\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003e This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.

In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\r\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X.

Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\r\n5.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation\u0027s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. \u003ca name\u003d\"openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense2\"\u003eYou must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code\u003c/a\u003e.

If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\u0027 reputations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0027s free use or not licensed at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003col start\u003d\"0\" style\u003d\"margin-left: -14\"\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003e This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.

However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cli\u003eYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.

In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\r\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor\u0027s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\r\n5.

By contrast,\r\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\r\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\r\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\r\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\r\nany other work released this way by its authors.

The systematic\r\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\r\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\r\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\r\nproducts.

In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\r\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor\u0027s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\r\n5.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation\u0027s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. \u003ca name\u003d\"openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense2\"\u003eYou must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code\u003c/a\u003e.

We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0027s free use or not licensed at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003col start\u003d\"0\" style\u003d\"margin-left: -14\"\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003e This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
